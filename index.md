# The Fluid Reality Project

## The Vision 
---------------------------------------

It is not just about consuming reality, but becoming an active participant in its creation, shaping our experiences and understanding of the world around us in a manner as unique as our own fingerprints.

_Stage 1:_ Digital Agents as a Service

## The Mission 
---------------------------------------
Our mission is to harness the power of advanced technologies, including AI, DLT, and simulations, to facilitate the Fluid Reality management.  
We strive to provide a robust, interactive, and inclusive platform where individuals and organizations can generate their own unique blend of factual and fictional realities.    
By doing so, we aim to broaden perspectives, foster creativity, enhance learning, and promote informed decision-making. Above all, we are committed to nurturing a safe and ethical environment for reality generation, ensuring transparency, authenticity, and respect for personal data privacy in all our services.


## Project Status
---------------------------------------
The project is in the initial development stages of developing the _Digital.Agents.Center_. 


## Development Approach
---------------------------------------


### Centers (PoC)       



Centers are the individual building blocks or modules of the project, each focusing on a specific aspect or functionality within the digital societies. They serve as Proof of Concepts (PoCs), representing early-stage prototypes designed to test and validate the feasibility and effectiveness of each concept or direction. By developing Centers first, the project can identify successful components to integrate into the larger platform structure.

#### **digital.agents.center** 
Acting as an incubator and marketspace for digital agents, this center supports the development and growth of AI-driven tools and services that can be used across the platforms.

<!--
#### **digital.libraries.center**
This center serves as a repository for digital content and knowledge, providing users with access to various resources and information relevant to the digital societies.

#### **digital.ledgers.center** 
Responsible for managing digital rewards and reputation ledgers, this center employs distributed ledger technology to ensure transparency, security, and fairness in the distribution of social rewards and the maintenance of social status within the digital societies.

#### **digital.debates.center** 
This center focuses on augmented analytics, providing a space for users to engage in social debates and discussions using advanced data analysis and visualization tools to support well-informed decision-making.

#### **digital.decisions.center** 
Dedicated to facilitating augmented decision-making processes, this center employs AI-driven tools and technologies to help users and communities make more informed, context-aware decisions in various aspects of their digital societies.

#### **digital.experiences.center** 
This center organizes and hosts digital events and competitions, offering users a platform to engage in interactive experiences, showcase their skills, and connect with others within the digital societies.
-->

### Secondary Platforms (MVP)      


After the successful validation of individual Centers, they are combined and integrated into one or both of the Secondary Platforms, IM.CITY (Factual Reality) and UR.CITY (Fictional Reality). The Secondary Platforms represent the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage, providing a functional yet streamlined experience for users. This stage aims to further test and validate the project's concepts and their interactions with each other in a more cohesive environment.

#### **[IM.CITY]** (for Factual Reality) 
Focused on representing accurate and verifiable information about the world, this platform offers a digital space where users can share knowledge, ideas, and experiences rooted in factual reality.

#### **[UR.CITY]** (for Fictional Reality) 
Dedicated to the imaginative and creative aspects of digital societies, this platform enables users to explore, share, and participate in fictional narratives, experiences, and environments.


### Main Platform (Beta)   


Once the Secondary Platforms have been successfully validated, they are merged into the Main Platform, IM.UR.CITY for Fluid Reality. The Main Platform constitutes the Beta version of the project, offering a more comprehensive and interconnected experience for users as it seamlessly blends the aspects of both Secondary Platforms. In this stage, the project undergoes additional testing, refinement, and expansion before reaching its final, fully-featured form.

#### **[IM.UR.CITY]** (for Fluid Reality) 
This platform combines both secondary platforms, providing an environment where the digital societies can interact, collaborate, and coexist in a seamless fusion of diverse social realities.


## Digital Societies Institute
---------------------------------------

IM.UR.CITY project is developing based on the conceptualization work conducted by the [Digital Societies Institute], the think tank for the future of digital societies. The Institute's focus on exploring cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology, aligns with IM.UR.CITY's mission to develop an innovative digital infrastructure for new Social Digital Reality. By collaborating with the [Digital Societies Institute] and leveraging its expertise, IM.UR.CITY aims to create a more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable digital society, incorporating modern concepts like network state, liquid democracy, universal basic income, poly-centric law, and digital identity.


**Join us** on this exciting journey and be a part of shaping the future of our society.
