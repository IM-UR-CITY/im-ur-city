## Changing the Way We Connect and Make Decisions through Intelligent Agents in Social Spaces Mediated by Technology
---------------------------------------

{: .highlight }
**IM.UR.CITY** is a platform for **Digital Societies** building new social frameworks by leveraging the transformative potential of cutting-edge technologies such as using **AI** & **DLT**


&nbsp;

At **IM.UR.CITY**, we are thrilled about the growing digitization of the world and the increased demand for intelligent agents that assist us in understanding and navigating it. However, current solutions for working with AI can be complex and difficult to use for the average person. That's why we're building IM.UR.CITY - to make it simple and accessible for everyone to interact with intelligent agents and take advantage of the benefits that AI can offer.

Our **twin projects**, UR.CITY and IM.CITY, work together to create a unique ecosystem where users can create, raise, and trade unique AI models.

**UR.CITY** (<strong>U</strong>n<strong>R</strong>eal City) serves as a simulator for artificial/intelligent agents, allowing users to experiment and have fun with AI in a virtual environment called an Artificial City.    

**IM.CITY** (<strong>I</strong>m<strong>M</strong>ersive City) serves as an incubator for new digital societies where these intelligent/expert agents come to life and can be utilized in the real world to facilitate social interactions and enhance decision-making within the Digital City.

With IM.UR.CITY, we want to empower individuals, organizations and communities to be more productive, to be more creative, and to be more informed. We believe that by providing a user-friendly platform that allows users to create, raise, and trade AI models in a simple and easy-to-use interface, we will open up new opportunities for growth and innovation in the field of artificial intelligence.

The future is here, and we at IM.UR.CITY are excited to be at the forefront of it. 

**Join us** on this exciting journey and be a part of shaping the future of AI technology.
