## Dashboard Game
----------------

**A "dashboard game" is a type of digital game where players interact with the ecosystem primarily through a digital dashboard or interface, which displays information and allows players to make decisions or take actions that impact the outcome of the game.**

A dashboard game not only refers to fictional contexts but also refers to factual contexts where the value is added and managed by convention, such as in a crypto exchange or other play-to-earn (P2E) systems. 
Players would interact with the dashboard to manage their assets, make trades or transactions, and track their progress within the game.
The dashboard could serve as a hub for social interactions, as in a social dashboard game, or as a platform for managing various aspects of a system or process, such as finance, inventory, or logistics.

For example, in a crypto exchange, players might use the dashboard to buy or sell cryptocurrencies, track market trends and pricing, and manage their portfolio of assets. The dashboard might also display information about security measures, account balances, and transaction history. Similarly, in a P2E system, players might use the dashboard to manage their digital items or virtual assets, participate in game activities, and track their earnings. The dashboard might also display information about in-game events, rewards, and rankings.
