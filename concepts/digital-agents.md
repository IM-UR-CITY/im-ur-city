## Digital Agents
----------------

Digital Agents refer to computer programs or algorithms that are designed to perform specific tasks, interact with their environment, and make decisions based on predefined goals or objectives.

They come in two types: Factual Reality Agents and Fictional Reality Agents.

### Factual Reality Agents

These are AI-based digital agents that perform various tasks, often autonomously or semi-autonomously. Factual Reality Agents employ AI techniques, such as machine learning, natural language processing, or computer vision, to process and analyze data, adapt to their environment, and make informed decisions.
They are generating _Factual Reality Data_.

### Fictional Reality Agents

These are digital agents that participate in simulated environments. They can mimic the behavior of real-world entities, such as humans, animals, or other objects, and interact with other agents or elements within the simulation. Artificial agents can be used to study complex systems, test hypotheses, or develop and evaluate strategies in a controlled environment.
They are generating _Fictional Reality Data_.
